Version numbers follow the linux convention, where the first number is the
major release.  voteamp is at zero because it is still in alpha.  The middle
number is the minor release; even numbers are considered stable and odd
numbers are for development.  The last number is the update level; these
should change fairly frequently.  The next release will be 0.1.1, then 0.1.2,
and so on.  Once the code becomes stable, it will be named 1.0.0, and the
1.1.x development tree will be forked.


History of changes in released versions:

0.1.1           added global TODO list
                put in CVS repository, mostly so I can keep track of changes.
