The crew at xaudio.com who wrote a nice, free mp3 player.  Their inclusion
of a stdin/stdout version made fxaudio possible.

My friend Roy Lee Saenz, who showed me how to redirect standard input and
output for a child process to a pipe, which made writing fxaudio possible.
He also suggested using stat(2) to check if a file had changed instead of
whatever lame method I was originally planning on. (MD5 hash?)

dentar@dentar.com, for writing tailbeep and making it open source, so I could
learn how to properly have a program daemonize itself.

The faculty and staff at the University of Texas at Austin, who taught me
how to program the right way.

Leander High School, for providing the network access that my system runs
on.

Of course, always glory needs to go to God.  He's the one who's gifted me
with the talent to do this stuff, the resources to pull it off, and a great
job that makes it possible.  In my life, Lord, be glorified.
