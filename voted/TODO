have this check the current_period file and automatically reset when it
	changes
log all votes with a timestamp
move input and output files into more /var/run and var/etc(?)

clean up code; move net stuff into separate source file (same as in voter?)
implement nonce/challenge-based security so passwords aren't sent in the clear
reinit if ballot changed or in response to SIGHUP
send ballot file to client
exponential back-off delay if can't lock state file
	(perhaps create state.lock in /tmp to make this easier)
figure out how to keep track of already voteds in forked implementation
	(use linux IPC shared memory?  non-portable)
choose random order for tie votes (not merely alphabetic)
implement all options from voted.ini (many are ignored)

- implement MD5 passwords
+ remove most of the debugging output
+ read info from ini
+ wipe state file every so often
+ checksum at end of votestring for sanity
+ maintain current pid in /var/run/voted.pid
+ run in background by default
