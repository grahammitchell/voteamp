figure out eventual coredump
playlist based on relative weights & not just absolute rank (i.e. handle ties)
make sure we actually get an appropriate number of tracks from an album
	before moving on
count number of tracks for current album before processing them, and then use
	that number to do something useful (i.e. do things more along the lines of
	the original explanation of the algorithm)

* only play tracks if they're not in the blacklist database
* make sure that we're cleaning up dynamically-allocated QUERY results
* prune tracks from the blacklist database once their waiting period is over
* reshuffle on SIGHUP
* daemonize automatically
* make sure this won't die with an empty input file
x read from ini
x handle command line parameters properly
